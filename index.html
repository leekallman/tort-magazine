          973 is a magazine that explores the creative culture of Cambridge. It
          defines this in the widest sense, covering art, design, music,
          architecture, food and drink, technology and everything that occupies
          the intersections between.
        </p>
        <p>
          It exists in print and has a home online. It is not defined by a
          format, or even a strict design, which will evolve over time and react
          to the content. Two issues will be created each year, with smaller
          pop-up publications happening on an ad hoc basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be free and available in hand picked locations across the
          city, details of which are below.<!-- A subscription is also available for £9.99 for Issue #1 and Issue #2, which will also guarantee you a copy of all pop-up publications. -->
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not advertising lead or even commercially orientated, so the
          content is meritocratic (as defined by The Editor). &lsquo;The
          Editor&rsquo; is Cambridge design practice The District, working in
          collaboration with generous partners and creative people who give
          their time, paper, ink, film, electricity, venues, minds, words,
          pictures, expertise, leaflet racks, beer, wine and spirits.
        </p>

          This theme decided itself. The name 973 derives from the year that the
          first market was officially opened in Cambridge and 1046 years on we
          open our metaphorical doors. In this issue we cover all things open;
          the first year since the re-opening of Kettle&rsquo;s Yard, and the
          &lsquo;open&rsquo; community housing development designed by Mole
          Architects. We explore the open spaces of Cambridge University Botanic
          Garden, and discuss the issue of open access to information with
          artist, Stuart Pearson Wright. We open some local brews with Old
          Friends Brewery and BrewBoard and we open a debate with the Cambridge
          Cookery School. We explore the best restaurants in Cambridge open to
          children and we open the hatch of Steak and Honour’s infamous Citroen
          H1 (the yellow one). We hope you enjoy.
